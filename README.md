# HER2_Breast_Cancer_Transcriptomic_Analisys
This is the code used for transcriptomic analysis of breast cancer patients. The code include, a part writen for bash in linux in which the
and abundances tables were created.

The second part was writen in R, in which the diferential expression analysis, heatmap, plots and other transformations were made.

I used the samples of 8 HER2 breast cancer patients for training data taken from the previous study GSE162187 made by our research group. For testing our results, the GSE162187 study was taken for validation as a test-data.

The GRCh38p.14 was used as reference genome

The paper in which the results are shown is title # "A Gene Expression Signature in HER2+ Breast Cancer Patients Related to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Resistance, Overall Survival, and Disease-Free Survival" #
